# Chatbot QA Automation (UI + AI Validation)
This project contains a lightweight QA automation suite for a bilingual (English/Arabic) chatbot.
The goal is to validate:
core UI behavior (load, send, render, scroll, accessibility)
AI response quality (helpfulness, relevance, formatting, EN/AR consistency)
security behavior (script injection + prompt injection)

> Note: This is a black box assignment. No real API credentials or internal documents are required. The chatbot behavior and evaluation signals are treated as an imaginary setup for task purpose.

# task includes:
Python 3.12
Playwright (Python) for UI automation
Pytest for test execution
Simple heuristic evaluators for AI output validation
